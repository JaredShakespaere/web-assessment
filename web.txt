Question #1: How does the internet work? 

the internet is a series of networks strung together. At the bottom level, your computer and all your devices are connected to a router.
Your neighbors computer and all their devices are connected to a router. And everybody has their own little network of their own devices. 
Then all of our little networks connect to each other through servers and makes the internet.




Question #2: What happens when you click on a link?

the client, or person/device looking at anything front-end on an app will click on something, 
it will send a request to the server (the request is actually translated into JSON to be sent)
the server will break up the request to process it and as the server checks off parts of the request that passed
those parts will be sent back to the client, so they can have immediate feedback. This happens till all the parts of the 
request are sent back.
