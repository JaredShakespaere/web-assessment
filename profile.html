		<h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Personal Trainer</h2>
	
		<p>
			My name is Jared Shakespaere and I am a personal trainer. 
            I pride myself in being different from the rest, so let me 
            tell you a little bit about me!

            <div id="career" style= "font-size: 24pt" >My Career</div>
                <p>
                    In my years of being a personal trainer, I have 
                    found that my niche, or area of specialty, is training
                    athletes. I used to train athletes in person, but I am switching
                    my focus to the online sector for a few reasons.
                </p>
                    <ol>
			            <li>I can reach more clientele</li>
                            <p>
                                This makes it easier for me to scale my business.
                            </p>
			            <li>It helps my athletes be more self-sufficient</li>
                            <p>
                                When my athletes have to workout alone and they have 
                                great remote coaching, they are able to pick up cues
                                a lot quicker than when I hold their hand through the workout.                          
                              </p>
			            <li>Better work-life balance</li>
                              <p>
                                  Normal hours for a trainer are crazy. Think of the time
                                  you normally go to the gym. It's usually in the morning 
                                  or at night right? Well as a trainer, I need to be in the 
                                  gym at the same time as my clientele. So, that usually means
                                  I have a split schedule of 4 hours of work in the morning and 
                                  4 in the evening. It gets draining after sometime.
                              </p>
                    </ol>
                
                    <p>
                        At the end of the day, I love helping people reach their health goals whether
                        it's inside or outside the gym! So if you want to make a transformation in your
